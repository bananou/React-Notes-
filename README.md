# React Notes App
A simple and efficient note-taking app built using React, allowing users to create, edit, and delete notes. 
The app stores notes locally in the browser using localStorage, 
ensuring that the notes are persistent even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

**Edit Notes:** Users can modify existing notes by changing the title or details.
**Delete Notes:** Notes can be deleted if they are no longer needed.
**Search Notes:** Search functionality allows users to filter notes by title or content in real time.
**Local Storage:** All notes are stored in localStorage, so they remain available even after a browser refresh or restart.

## Technologies Used
**React:** Front-end library for building the UI.
**React Router:** For handling navigation between pages.
**UUID:** For generating unique IDs for each note.
**Local Storage:** To persist notes data locally in the browser.
